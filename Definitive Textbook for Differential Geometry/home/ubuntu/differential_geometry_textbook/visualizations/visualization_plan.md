## Implementation Plan

For each visualization:

1. Create a detailed sketch with clear labels and annotations
2. Include a brief explanation of what the visualization represents
3. Highlight key features that connect to the mathematical concepts
4. Ensure consistency in style and notation across all visualizations

The visualizations will be implemented using a combination of:
- Hand-drawn style sketches for geometric intuition
- Diagrams with precise mathematical notation
- Sequential illustrations to show dynamic processes
- Cross-sectional views for higher-dimensional concepts

Each visualization will be saved in the `/visualizations` directory and referenced in the appropriate chapters of the textbook.
