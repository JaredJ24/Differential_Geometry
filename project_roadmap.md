# MIT Differential Geometry 18.950 Textbook - Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
This roadmap outlines the iterative development process for creating a world-class, self-contained textbook for MIT's Differential Geometry 18.950 course that seamlessly merges mathematical rigor with intuitive accessibility.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation and Structure (Current Phase)
**Timeline: Weeks 1-2**
- âœ… Repository setup and environment configuration
- âœ… Initial analysis of existing chapter drafts
- âœ… Creation of development tracking tools
- ðŸ”„ Establish consistent chapter template based on pedagogical framework
- ðŸ”„ Define style guide for visual elements and notation
- ðŸ”„ Setup collaborative workflow for iterative development

### Phase 2: Content Enhancement (Chapter-by-Chapter)
**Timeline: Weeks 3-10**
- Enhance each chapter with required pedagogical elements:
  - Launch Pad sections
  - Prerequisite Bridge sections
  - Narrative Spine elements
  - Visualization Pipeline components
  - Interleaved Problem Sets
  - Easter Eggs for Experts
  - Cross-Pollination sections
  - Metacognitive Checklists
- Implement biweekly review cycle for each chapter
- Develop two chapters per week (estimated)

### Phase 3: Visual and Interactive Elements
**Timeline: Weeks 11-14**
- Create 3Blue1Brown-inspired visualizations
- Develop dynamic diagrams for key concepts
- Design QR codes linking to supplementary animations
- Create Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration
- Implement flowchart summaries for complex proofs

### Phase 4: Supplementary Materials
**Timeline: Weeks 15-16**
- Develop instructor resources
- Create student companion materials
- Compile notation guides and glossary
- Develop "Further Reading" lists
- Create appendices for additional mathematical background

### Phase 5: Integration and Quality Assurance
**Timeline: Weeks 17-18**
- Compile complete LaTeX/PDF version
- Prepare web version with interactive elements
- Conduct comprehensive review for consistency
- Implement feedback from student testing
- Finalize all deliverables

## Iterative Development Workflow

### Sprint Cycle (2 weeks per cycle)
1. **Planning (Days 1-2)**
   - Review requirements for target chapters
   - Define specific enhancements and additions
   - Assign tasks and set milestones

2. **Development (Days 3-10)**
   - Implement enhancements to chapters
   - Create visual elements
   - Develop problem sets
   - Add pedagogical components

3. **Review (Days 11-12)**
   - Conduct peer review of changes
   - Test with sample audience if possible
   - Document feedback and issues

4. **Refinement (Days 13-14)**
   - Address feedback and issues
   - Finalize changes for the sprint
   - Commit and push updates
   - Plan for next sprint

### Collaboration Guidelines
- Use GitHub issues to track specific tasks and enhancements
- Create feature branches for major changes
- Use pull requests for review before merging
- Maintain detailed commit messages describing changes
- Update todo.md file as tasks are completed

## Milestone Schedule

### Milestone 1: Foundation Complete
**Target: End of Week 2**
- Repository structure established
- Development environment configured
- Chapter template and style guide created
- Initial chapter review completed

### Milestone 2: First Chapter Set Enhanced
**Target: End of Week 6**

### Milestone 3: Second Chapter Set Enhanced
**Target: End of Week 10**
- Chapters 6-10 enhanced with all pedagogical elements
- Complete set of problem sets developed
- All narrative elements implemented

### Milestone 4: Visual Elements Complete
**Target: End of Week 14**
- All visualizations created
- Interactive elements developed
- QR codes and supplementary materials linked

### Milestone 5: Final Deliverable
**Target: End of Week 18**
