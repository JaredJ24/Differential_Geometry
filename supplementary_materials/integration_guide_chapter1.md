     - `curvature_examples.png`: Comparison of curves with different curvature properties
     - `reparametrization.png`: Comparison of uniform vs non-uniform parametrization

3. `/home/ubuntu/MIT_Differential_Geometry_18.950_Textbook/supplementary_materials/problem_sets/chapter1_problem_sets.md`
   - Additional interleaved problem sets with tiered difficulty:
     - Problem Set 1.2: Reparametrization and Arc Length
     - Problem Set 1.3: Curvature and the Frenet Frame
     - Problem Set 1.4: Applications and Connections
   - Each set includes foundational, exploratory, and proofcraft problems

## Integration Instructions

### 1. Visualization References
Add the following references to the Visualization Pipeline section in chapter1_enhanced.md:

```markdown
### Additional Visualizations

For interactive exploration of these concepts, refer to the supplementary visualizations:

- **Helix with Frenet Frame**: A three-dimensional visualization showing the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors along a helix.
- **Arc Length Parametrization**: A graph illustrating the relationship between the parameter t and arc length s.
- **Curvature Examples**: Comparison of curves with different curvature properties, including circle, line, and ellipse.
- **Reparametrization Comparison**: Visual demonstration of the difference between uniform (arc length) and non-uniform parametrization.

These visualizations can be found in the supplementary materials folder and are available as both static images and interactive Python scripts.
```

### 2. Problem Set Integration
Add the following reference to the Interleaved Problem Sets section in chapter1_enhanced.md:

```markdown
### Additional Problem Sets

For further practice and deeper exploration, see the supplementary problem sets:

- **Problem Set 1.2: Reparametrization and Arc Length**: Explore the relationship between different parametrizations and the intrinsic arc length.
- **Problem Set 1.3: Curvature and the Frenet Frame**: Develop proficiency with calculating and interpreting curvature and the Frenet frame.
- **Problem Set 1.4: Applications and Connections**: Apply curve theory to physics, computer graphics, and other domains.

Each problem set includes foundational exercises, exploratory investigations, and guided proof constructions.
```

### 3. QR Code Placeholders
Add the following to the end of the chapter1_enhanced.md file:

```markdown
## Interactive Resources

Scan the QR codes below to access interactive versions of the key visualizations:

[QR CODE PLACEHOLDER: Helix with Frenet Frame Interactive Visualization]

[QR CODE PLACEHOLDER: Curve Reparametrization Interactive Demonstration]

[QR CODE PLACEHOLDER: Curvature Explorer Tool]

These interactive tools allow you to manipulate parameters and observe the effects on curve properties in real-time.
```

## Next Steps
1. Generate actual QR codes linking to hosted versions of the visualizations
2. Create a LaTeX version of the chapter incorporating all enhancements
3. Develop Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration of the concepts
4. Implement student feedback mechanism for the enhanced chapter
