## Integration Instructions

### 1. Visualization References
Add the following references to the Visualization Pipeline section in chapter2_enhanced.md:

```markdown
### Additional Visualizations

For interactive exploration of these concepts, refer to the supplementary visualizations:

- **Osculating Circles and Evolute**: A visualization of an ellipse with osculating circles at various points and its evolute.
- **Curvature of Ellipse**: A graph showing how curvature varies along an ellipse as a function of parameter.
- **Curve Comparison**: Comparison of different curves (circle, parabola, sine curve) with their distinct curvature properties.
- **Curvature Comparison**: Graphs showing the curvature functions for different types of curves.
- **Four Vertex Theorem**: Illustration of a closed curve with its vertices (points of extremal curvature) and osculating circles.

These visualizations can be found in the supplementary materials folder and are available as both static images and interactive Python scripts.
```

### 2. Problem Set Integration
Add the following reference to the Interleaved Problem Sets section in chapter2_enhanced.md:

```markdown
### Additional Problem Sets

For further practice and deeper exploration, see the supplementary problem sets:

- **Problem Set 2.3: Osculating Circles and Evolutes**: Explore the relationship between curves, their osculating circles, and evolutes.
- **Problem Set 2.4: Global Properties of Curvature**: Investigate properties like the Four Vertex Theorem and total curvature of closed curves.
- **Problem Set 2.5: Applications of Curvature**: Apply curvature concepts to computer graphics, optics, general relativity, and more.

Each problem set includes foundational exercises, exploratory investigations, and guided proof constructions.
```

### 3. QR Code Placeholders
Add the following to the end of the chapter2_enhanced.md file:

```markdown
## Interactive Resources

Scan the QR codes below to access interactive versions of the key visualizations:

[QR CODE PLACEHOLDER: Osculating Circles and Evolute Interactive Visualization]

[QR CODE PLACEHOLDER: Curvature Explorer Tool]

[QR CODE PLACEHOLDER: Four Vertex Theorem Demonstration]

These interactive tools allow you to manipulate parameters and observe the effects on curvature properties in real-time.
```

## Next Steps
1. Generate actual QR codes linking to hosted versions of the visualizations
2. Create a LaTeX version of the chapter incorporating all enhancements
3. Develop Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration of the concepts
4. Implement student feedback mechanism for the enhanced chapter
5. Begin enhancement of Chapter 3 following the same approach
