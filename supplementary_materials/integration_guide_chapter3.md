## Integration Instructions

### 1. Visualization References
Add the following references to the Visualization Pipeline section in chapter3_enhanced.md:

```markdown
### Additional Visualizations

For interactive exploration of these concepts, refer to the supplementary visualizations:

- **Light Cone and Vector Classification**: A visualization showing the division of the Minkowski plane into timelike, spacelike, and lightlike regions.
- **Lorentz Transformation Grid**: An illustration of how a coordinate grid transforms under a Lorentz transformation, demonstrating the hyperbolic rotation nature of these transformations.
- **Minkowski Curvature**: Visualization of the curvature of a hyperbola in the Minkowski plane, showing tangent and normal vectors.
- **Causal Structure**: Diagram illustrating causal relationships between events in spacetime, with light cones determining which events can influence others.

These visualizations can be found in the supplementary materials folder and are available as both static images and interactive Python scripts.
```

### 2. Problem Set Integration
Add the following reference to the Interleaved Problem Sets section in chapter3_enhanced.md:

```markdown
### Additional Problem Sets

For further practice and deeper exploration, see the supplementary problem sets:

- **Problem Set 3.3: Minkowski Geometry and Special Relativity**: Explore the fundamental concepts of the Minkowski plane and their applications in special relativity.
- **Problem Set 3.4: Hyperboloid Model and Hyperbolic Geometry**: Investigate the connection between the Minkowski plane and hyperbolic geometry through the hyperboloid model.
- **Problem Set 3.5: Applications of Minkowski Geometry**: Apply Minkowski geometry concepts to problems in physics, including relativistic energy-momentum relations and proper acceleration.

Each problem set includes foundational exercises, exploratory investigations, and guided proof constructions.
```

### 3. QR Code Placeholders
Add the following to the end of the chapter3_enhanced.md file:

```markdown
## Interactive Resources

Scan the QR codes below to access interactive versions of the key visualizations:

[QR CODE PLACEHOLDER: Light Cone and Causal Structure Interactive Visualization]

[QR CODE PLACEHOLDER: Lorentz Transformation Explorer]

[QR CODE PLACEHOLDER: Hyperboloid Model of Hyperbolic Geometry]

These interactive tools allow you to manipulate parameters and observe the effects on spacetime geometry in real-time.
```

## Next Steps
1. Generate actual QR codes linking to hosted versions of the visualizations
2. Create a LaTeX version of the chapter incorporating all enhancements
3. Develop Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration of the concepts
4. Implement student feedback mechanism for the enhanced chapter
5. Begin enhancement of Chapter 4 following the same approach
