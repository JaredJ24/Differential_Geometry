## Integration Instructions

### 1. Visualizations Integration

The visualizations for Chapter 4 are located in:
```
/supplementary_materials/visualizations/chapter4/
```

These visualizations should be referenced in the following sections of the chapter:

- **Frenet Frame Visualization**: Reference in Section 2 (The Frenet Frame in Three Dimensions)
  - Add: "See Figure 4.1 for a visualization of the Frenet frame along a helix."

- **Planes Visualization**: Reference in Section 2 after introducing osculating, normal, and rectifying planes
  - Add: "Figure 4.2 illustrates these three planes at a point on a helix."

- **Curvature and Torsion Visualization**: Reference in Section 3 (Fundamental Theorem of Curve Theory)
  - Add: "Figure 4.3 compares the curvature and torsion of different curves, including a straight line, circle, helix, and trefoil knot."

- **Fundamental Theorem Visualization**: Reference in Section 3 after Theorem 4.10
  - Add: "Figure 4.4 shows curves generated from different curvature and torsion functions, illustrating the Fundamental Theorem."

- **Special Curves Visualization**: Reference in Section 5 (Special Types of Curves)
  - Add: "Figures 4.5 and 4.6 illustrate Bertrand curves, Mannheim curves, evolutes, and involutes."

- **Higher-Dimensional Frenet Frame**: Reference in Section 4 (Curves in Higher Dimensions)
  - Add: "Figure 4.7 shows a projection of the Frenet frame for a curve in 4D space."

### 2. Problem Sets Integration

The problem sets should be integrated at strategic points in the chapter:

- **Problem Set 4.1**: Insert after Section 2 (The Frenet Frame in Three Dimensions)
  - Replace the existing "Interleaved Problem Set 1" with the enhanced version

- **Problem Set 4.2**: Insert after Section 3 (Fundamental Theorem of Curve Theory)
  - Replace the existing "Interleaved Problem Set 2" with the enhanced version

- **Problem Set 4.3**: Insert after Section 5 (Special Types of Curves)
  - Add this as a new problem set

### 3. QR Codes for Animations

For each visualization, create a QR code that links to an online animation:

1. Host the animations on a suitable platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, YouTube)
2. Generate QR codes for each animation URL
3. Insert the QR codes in the printed textbook next to the corresponding figures

### 4. Digital Companion Integration

For the digital version of the textbook:

1. Embed interactive versions of the visualizations
2. Add links to Jupyter notebooks that allow students to manipulate parameters
3. Include solutions to selected problems with step-by-step explanations

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Insert references to visualizations in the appropriate sections
- [ ] Replace existing problem sets with enhanced versions
- [ ] Generate and insert QR codes for animations
- [ ] Create interactive versions for digital companion
- [ ] Develop Jupyter notebooks for key concepts
- [ ] Review integration for consistency and flow

## Notes for Instructors

When teaching this chapter:

1. Emphasize the geometric intuition behind the Frenet frame
2. Use the visualizations to demonstrate how curvature and torsion affect the shape of curves
3. Assign problems of varying difficulty based on students' backgrounds
4. Encourage exploration of the interactive elements in the digital companion
5. Connect the mathematical concepts to applications in physics, computer graphics, and biology

## Notes for Students

When studying this chapter:

1. Start by understanding the geometric meaning of the Frenet frame
2. Use the visualizations to build intuition before diving into the formulas
3. Work through the foundational problems before attempting the exploratory and proofcraft problems
4. Explore the interactive elements in the digital companion to reinforce understanding
5. Connect the abstract concepts to concrete applications in the Cross-Pollination section
