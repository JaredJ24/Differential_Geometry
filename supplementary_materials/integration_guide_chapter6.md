# Integration Guide for Chapter 6: Closed Curves and the Jordan Curve Theorem

## Overview

This guide provides instructions for integrating the enhanced pedagogical elements into Chapter 6 of the MIT Differential Geometry 18.950 Textbook. The enhancements include visualizations, problem sets, and structural improvements that follow the dual-track approach balancing rigor with accessibility.

## Visualization Integration

### Primary Visualizations

1. **Jordan Curve Theorem Visualizations (jordan_curve_theorem_visualizations.png)**
   - **Location**: Insert after Section 6.2 "The Jordan Curve Theorem"
   - **Caption**: "Figure 6.1: Visualizations of key concepts in the theory of closed curves: (a) Simple vs. non-simple closed curves, (b) The Jordan Curve Theorem showing interior and exterior regions, (c) Winding numbers for points inside and outside a curve, (d) Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem, (e) Rotation numbers for different curves, (f) Isoperimetric inequality comparing different shapes."
   - **Integration Notes**: Reference this figure when discussing the geometric interpretation of the Jordan Curve Theorem. Add cross-references in the text: "As illustrated in Figure 6.1(b), a simple closed curve divides the plane into exactly two regions: a bounded interior and an unbounded exterior."

2. **Four Vertex Theorem (four_vertex_theorem.png)**
   - **Location**: Insert after Section 6.8 "The Four Vertex Theorem"
   - **Caption**: "Figure 6.2: The Four Vertex Theorem illustrated on an ellipse. The four vertices (marked in red) are points where the curvature reaches local extrema. The osculating circles at these points are shown in gray."
   - **Integration Notes**: Reference this figure when explaining the Four Vertex Theorem. Add explanatory text: "As shown in Figure 6.2, an ellipse has exactly four vertices: two points of maximum curvature at the ends of the minor axis, and two points of minimum curvature at the ends of the major axis."

3. **Gauss-Bonnet Theorem (gauss_bonnet_theorem.png)**
   - **Location**: Insert after Section 6.7 "The Gauss-Bonnet Theorem for Plane Curves"
   - **Caption**: "Figure 6.3: The Gauss-Bonnet Theorem for plane curves. Different curves (circle, ellipse, rounded square) all have the same total curvature of 2π, despite their different shapes."
   - **Integration Notes**: Use this figure to illustrate the invariance of total curvature. Add text: "Figure 6.3 demonstrates that curves with very different shapes all have the same total curvature of 2π, as guaranteed by the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem."

4. **Whitney-Graustein Theorem (whitney_graustein_theorem.png)**
   - **Location**: Insert after Section 6.5 "The Rotation Number and the Whitney-Graustein Theorem"
   - **Caption**: "Figure 6.4: The Whitney-Graustein Theorem illustrated with curves of different rotation numbers. From left to right: rotation number 1 (circle), rotation number 0 (figure-eight), and rotation number 2 (double circle)."
   - **Integration Notes**: Reference this figure when discussing the classification of curves by rotation number. Add text: "Figure 6.4 shows three curves with different rotation numbers. According to the Whitney-Graustein Theorem, curves with different rotation numbers cannot be deformed into each other through regular homotopies."

### QR Codes for Interactive Content

1. **Create QR codes linking to online versions of the visualizations**
   - **Location**: Insert in the margin next to each corresponding figure
   - **Caption**: "Scan to view interactive version"
   - **Integration Notes**: The QR codes should link to web pages where students can manipulate parameters and explore the concepts dynamically.

## Problem Set Integration

### Interleaved Problem Sets

1. **Problem Set 3: Winding Numbers and the Jordan Curve Theorem**
   - **Location**: Insert after Section 6.3 "Winding Number and the Jordan Curve Theorem"
   - **Integration Notes**: Add a brief introduction: "The following problems explore the relationship between winding numbers and the Jordan Curve Theorem, providing both computational practice and theoretical insights."

2. **Problem Set 4: Rotation Numbers and the Whitney-Graustein Theorem**
   - **Location**: Insert after Section 6.5 "The Rotation Number and the Whitney-Graustein Theorem"
   - **Integration Notes**: Add a brief introduction: "These problems will help you develop intuition about rotation numbers and understand the classification of closed curves provided by the Whitney-Graustein Theorem."

3. **Problem Set 5: The Isoperimetric Inequality and the Four Vertex Theorem**
   - **Location**: Insert after Section 6.8 "The Four Vertex Theorem"
   - **Integration Notes**: Add a brief introduction: "The following problems explore two fundamental results about the global properties of curves: the isoperimetric inequality and the Four Vertex Theorem."

### Problem Set Cross-References

1. **Add cross-references to relevant problems throughout the text**
   - **Example**: After discussing the Jordan Curve Theorem, add: "See Problem 6.25 for an application of the Jordan Curve Theorem to prove the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem."
   - **Example**: After introducing the isoperimetric inequality, add: "Problems 6.37-6.39 provide practice with calculating the isoperimetric ratio for various shapes."
